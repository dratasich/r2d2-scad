External CAD
============

Most of my STL files are based on the official CS:R CAD files
from [astromech.net](http://astromech.net). You will need an account to
download the archive "Blueprints/01-Official/CS-R Blueprints/CSR - CAD.zip".

If you have FreeCAD installed you can use the script `convert_all.bash` in this
folder to automatically extract the archive and convert all IGES files to STL.
